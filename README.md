# Pytom2
Pytom + Atom = Pytom.
Pytom was a BSC project to make an API with the pourpose of getting easily PDB data in to JSON format. Of course, this was only a learning project for students of Python. Despite that, we are more than excited to work here and make this project.
Also, as yo can see, this is Pytom2, actually you can take a look to Pytom-Project repository (wich is the Pytom1) on mi GitHub page. That project was intended to be an API and at some point it was! You can actually take a look to all the commits and see that on the early days, the full pourpose of this API was satisfied. The problem was that I am not an experienced programmer so after achiving my goals and having like two weeks to still doing thinks I said to myself: ___"Well, may now can improve my project and add some features".___ Yes, I improved the functionality a lot, even the code organisation and standarization, but I was converting an API in to another thing just because I didn't know exactly how an API works.
Worry not, my program (Pytom-Project) works correctly and do a lot of things! But I surely want to make a working API so knowing what I've learned doing Pytom-Project I decided to start from zero and make Pytom2 just with learning pourposes.

## Rest API with Flask
With Pytom-Project I meet Flask and I felt in love. Sure, it's not as advanced like Django but I often struggles trying to use the advanced functions of Flask so at this moment it's more than enugh. With flask I can make an API, a WebApp or even a fully functional WebPage, so for this project and my future me, Flask it's a bless.

## Main pourpose
Pytom-Project it's at version 0.4.0 (+0.1 for every major change or branch merge and +0.0.1 for every commit) or so and it's not going to go more high. Luckly, Pytom2 uses some functions of Pytom-Project so I decided to keep the same version on Pytom2 and go from that point. I don't know if I'm going to make throught the full project because honestly, this is only a "time waster until holydays", but I want to learn in this little time. Another problem is that I probably can't continue with this after holydays because BSC is going to assing me to a real project.

Despite of that, the main pourpose of the project will be to get data mainly, but also, apply philters to that data. I have a lot of possibilities to make this and the Biopython libraries (not used in Python-Project) are in some way complete (but a bit confusing).

## End
Sayd that, thanks for take a look and excuse every ortographic mistake I maded here (probably not little ones or low quantity of them), but I like to express myself without use any translator (but an ortographic corrector would be perfect).
